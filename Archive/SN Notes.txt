Label with wide space below
	add some instructions

CHECKBOXES
Label HTML not working if checkbox is inserted right after
	put label in a container

Checkbox cannot be made mandatory via client scripts or UI policies
	make it manatory in the variable definition

If checkbox in containers, "Option" label will appear on top of each section
	Custom Label hide it, UI policy will hide checkbox as well though

Review Workflow for Manage Cedar-Sinai Network Account
	Manage Cedar-Sinai Network Account -> Account gets droped in new use OU -> Data Security need to finish process manually 
	If data security still working on task, the OU will NOT say "org/users"

MDRH Registry staff terminiated so the form drop down doesn't show their name, so they create a new user

Before Business Rules
	Can't use gr.update() before insert
	Be careful using GlideRecord Queries on before insert business rules. Records may not have been created in the database yet. Instead try to dot-walk to related records

ACL
	need both ROW ACL AND Variable to make a field show
	Ex. change_task ACL + change_task.u_validation need to be enabled to see u_validation

Workflow not advancing
	Inserting a record that matches the state of a wait condition in a worfklow will not advance the workflow. Need to update the workflow via script.
	new Workflow().runFlows(rec, 'update'); // rec is the GlideRecord
